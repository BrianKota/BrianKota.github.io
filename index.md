### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, is my favorite because of the cool animations that we learned how to do with coding. I learned how to use ifstream to read the contents of an ANSI animation file and print it to the terminal one character at a time. Using std::chrono to implement a time interval for however long you set the duration was very interesting to me. I was amazed with how many c++ libraries there are such as the chrono library that was used for part 3 of the lab.
