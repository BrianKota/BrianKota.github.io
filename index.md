### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    Lab 8, is my favorite because of the cool animations that we learned how to do with coding. I learned how to use ifstream to read the contents of an ANSI animation file and print it to the terminal one character at a time. Using std::chrono to implement a time interval for however long you set the duration was very interesting to me. I was amazed with how many c++ libraries there are such as the chrono library that was used for part 3 of the lab.

* Lab 11

    Lab 11 is my second favorite. It was super fun for me because it was a sneak peak to object-oriented programming. Although I did not make a class from scratch, I learned how to effectively use classes that has already been made for me. I learned from this lab that classes makes it easier to work with objects.

* Lab 6
    
    Lab 6 was also a favorite of mine because it introduced me to getting stuck on a problem that was so simple. I remember looking over the code for at least 2 hours just to find out I had to switch guess = guess2 to guess2 = guess. My mind went crazy over something that could've been fixed in less than 5 minutes, but it was all worth it in the end because I came out as a better problem solver.
